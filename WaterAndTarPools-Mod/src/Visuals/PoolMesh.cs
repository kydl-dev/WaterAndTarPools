    ///   - the render mesh covers the WHOLE grid (PrebuildMesh: one vertex per grid point, every quad is drawn),
    ///   - a wet grid point (depth > 0) gets y = ground + max(depth, 0.1 m), a dry one gets y = ground height (CalcVertex),
    ///   - the vertex colour alpha is 0 for dry points and 1 for wet ones.
    /// For a tar pit on a gentle slope that is fine: the dry points sit on the ground. But the walls of a pool are cells whose ground height is the TOP of the wall
    /// (TarPitWalls.ApplyWalls), so the quads between the water and the first wall cells climb straight up to the top of the wall: a translucent sheet
    /// (with spiky triangles, because each quad is split along one diagonal) hangs on the wall, and the ocean material does not hide it with the vertex alpha.
    ///
    /// Fix, for volumes of type Water only (every one of them is a pool of this mod): while the worker thread builds the mesh a dry grid point
    ///   - within [Visuals] PoolMeshReach cells of a wet one is put at min(ground, lowest wet surface in that window) = the water plane simply continues
    ///     under the wall / the bank (hidden by it) instead of climbing it,
    ///   - further away is sunk 1 m under the ground (hidden by the terrain, like the game's own physics mesh does).
