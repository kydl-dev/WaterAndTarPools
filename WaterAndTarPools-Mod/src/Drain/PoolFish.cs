    /// Why (read from the game's Fish code): a fish only knows it is in water through SetLiquidLevel, which the liquid's trigger calls. A pump pool is a
    /// LiquidVolume whose LiquidSurface trigger is a thin sheet at the surface, so a fish UNDER the surface is never inside it: m_inWater stays -10000,
    /// IsOutOfWater() is true, gravity is switched on and the fish flops on the pool floor. And for swimming the fish asks GetWaterLevel(), which without
    /// a WaterVolume (sea / lake) returns the fixed 30 m sea level, so in a pool above the sea every waypoint looks like dry land.
    /// Fix: while a fish is inside a pump WATER pool (its x/z on the grid with some water, and not far above the surface) its water level is the
    /// pool surface, every physics step before the fish's own update; GetWaterLevel answers the pool surface for points over the pool. Fish in the
    /// sea / lakes (a WaterVolume) are never touched. Leaving the pool hands the fish back to the game (water level -10000 = out of water).
